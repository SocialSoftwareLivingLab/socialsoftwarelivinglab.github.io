S2L2 stands for Social Software Living Lab. It prepares students for responsible and ethical software development using modern and innovative techniques. Students act as problem solvers, using their skills to provide solutions for society. This way, they explore the concept of Social Software Engineering in practice when delivering social change (software) instruments for the community beyond the university.
