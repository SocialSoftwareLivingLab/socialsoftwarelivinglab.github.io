  - Their use is clearly disclosed in project documentation or commit messages;
  - The content is critically reviewed and understood by team members;
  - Their use does not replace the learning or decision-making of human participants.
- AI-generated content must not be presented as original student work.
- External code or libraries must be properly cited in the README or comments.

## 8. Ethical Governance

S2L2 has an **Internal Ethics and Conduct Committee**, composed of:
- One faculty coordinator;

- One external member (e.g., former participant or affiliated mentor).

This committee is responsible for:
- Receiving and handling complaints confidentially;
- Ensuring fair and respectful resolution processes;
- Recommending corrective actions or disciplinary measures;
- Referring cases to institutional authorities when needed (e.g., academic board, ombudsperson).

---

## 9. Disciplinary Measures

Violations of this Code may lead to:
- Verbal or written warnings;
- Temporary suspension or removal from the project;
- Permanent dismissal from S2L2 and loss of related benefits (e.g., scholarships, certificates);
- Escalation to university-level procedures, if applicable.

All cases will be investigated with transparency and respect for due process.

## 10. Final Provisions

- This Code is subject to regular review by S2L2 leadership.
- All participants must sign the **Ethical Commitment Agreement** before engaging in lab activities.
- Suggestions or feedback can be submitted to the Ethics Committee at any time.
